# My Own Game

BOOM! An alien has crashed from outer space onto earth in a jungle located in Central America. The controller to turn on the ship had fallen out and the alien has to retrieve it to return back home. BEWARE, there are many dangers in the jungle such as poison ivy vines and vicious plants that have to be avoided. If the alien manages to get touched by the poison ivy or eaten by the deadly plants, it will not be able to return home but if it consumes the healthy fruits, it will gain an extra life. Your mission is to guide the alien through the jungle safely so it can return home.
